Vanilla Forums plugin that allows building plugin skeletons.

This plugin has an extensible "snippet" collection. If there things which might be more often in one of your starter plugins, you could make it a snippet and add it to the snippet directory. That way you ould be able to include the code just by ticking a checkbox.

This plugin will not help writing you code and/or logic. It is merely meant for making a tedious task more simple.
